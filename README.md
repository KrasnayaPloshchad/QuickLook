## Background
One of the few features I missed from Mac OS X is [Quick Look](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_Look). It allows user peek into a file content in a lightening speed by just pressing the <kbd>Space</kbd> key. Windows, on the other hand, does not has this handy feature ... until now.

I am aware that several alternatives are already available on the Internet (e.g. [WinQuickLook](https://github.com/shibayan/WinQuickLook) and [Seer](https://github.com/ccseer/Seer)). Despite these options, I still decide to craft another one by myself, because they are either not being actively developed, lacks of variety, or asks for a amount of $$$.

## Highlights

 - Tons of supported file types (full list [here](https://github.com/xupefei/QuickLook/wiki/Supported-File-Types))
 - Fluent design (new in version 0.3)
 - Touchscreen friendly
 - HiDPI support
 - Preview from Open and Save File Dialog
 - Preview from 3rd-party file managers (see a list [here](https://github.com/xupefei/QuickLook/wiki/File-Managers))
 - Easy extended by plugins 
 - Strict GPL license to keep it free forever
